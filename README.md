# random-episode

Are you tired of thinking about which audio drama you should listen to
tonight in order to fall asleep smoothly? Me too!

## (a small selection of) Todos

- Write a schedulable (serverless?) job to fetch and persist new episodes
(I don't want to get on Spotify's nerves each time I use random-episode)
- Find a suitable cloud provider to run the job periodically
- find a cheap (free?) cloud storage for persistance
- add an artist selector
- i18n

## Getting started

Install node modules:

`npm install`

Run the app in development mode:

`npm run start`

## Remarks

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
